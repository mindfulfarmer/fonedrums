# 🥁 FoneDrums
A high-fidelity, synthesis-based drum machine.
FoneDrums is a lightweight, low-latency web application designed to turn your mobile device or desktop into a playable drum pad. Unlike typical web drum kits that play pre-recorded MP3 samples, FoneDrums uses the Web Audio API to synthesize sounds in real-time, allowing for dynamic sound shaping, zero file-loading lag, and a tiny memory footprint.

## ✨ Features
1. ⚡ Zero Latency & Synthesis Based: All sounds are generated procedurally using Oscillators, White Noise Buffers, and Biquad Filters. No external audio files are loaded.
2. 📱 Mobile-First Design: Optimized for touch interactions with touch-action management to prevent scrolling/zooming while playing.
3. 🎛 9 Unique Drum Kits: Modern Studio, Vintage Warm, Trap 808, 80s Electric, Heavy Metal, Deep House, Tight Jazz, Industrial, Chiptune
4. 🔊 Sustain Mode: A toggleable sustain feature that drastically alters decay times for creative sound design.
5. 📐 Responsive Layout: Uses CSS Grid to adapt the pad layout between Portrait (3x2) and Landscape (2x4) orientations automatically.
6. 🎨 Dynamic Visuals: CSS-based 3D pad styling with active states and responsive lighting effects.

## 🎮 Controls
1. The Pads: Tap to play.
2. FoneDrums Logo: Tap the header logo to open the Settings/Kit Selection menu.
3. Sustain Button: Toggle to extend the decay of the drums (great for ambient swells or 808 bass).
